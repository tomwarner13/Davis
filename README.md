# Davis family website

That's Jenkin Davis (or Davies), my great-great-.......-great-grampa, who came from County Cardigan, Wales, to Radnor Township, Pennsylvania, around 1719.  After a few years he bought land on Conestoga Creek in Earl Township, and eventually relocated there.  He died in 1747, leaving a large and growing family that spread out over southern Pennsylvania and central Maryland. 

Our branch of the family is descended from Eli Davis, 1809-1887, of Frederick, MD.
