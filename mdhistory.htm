          240 acres, and passed his portion in turn to his son, R. Lee
          [1867-1939]. Lee Davis kept superb records of the farm's operation,
          especially around the turn of the 20th Century, saving papers,
          ledgers, receipts, and correspondence that collectively provide a
          remarkably clear picture of how a dairy farm was run in an age when
          machinery was fast replacing horsepower. The records were preserved
          after the 1945 sale of the farm by Lee's son, Aubrey [1895-1959], and
          came to light only in 1998, when they were sorted and donated to the

  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Family History
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">For over one hundred years, the Davis family
  owned a farm in an area of Frederick County, Maryland, called New Market.
  William Morsell, Sr. (1745-1813), grandfather of Rachel Morsell Davis,
  originally bought land in the 1780s and added to it through smaller purchases
  throughout his life. Morsell, a Quaker, was a surveyor and apparently a
  merchant as well. He had three daughters and one son, William Morsell, Jr.
  (1778-1846). He employed a number of servants and owned one slave, Abraham,
  whom he set free as a provision of his 1808 will.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">William Morsell, Jr., continued to accumulate
  more land adjacent to the original tract. Various portions of this land were
  referred to as Prather’s Adventure, Partnership, Solomon’s Flower, Long
  Range, and the Lady. William Morsell, Jr. had only one child, Rachel Morsell
  Davis (1809-1886), who became his sole heir.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">George Davis (1775-1850), a Quaker farmer and
  merchant who was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was the father of Eli Davis
  (1809-1887). Eli married Rachel Morsell in 1832, and the story of their
  elopement was &quot;a little romantic,&quot; according to J. Thomas Scharf in
  his <i>History of Western Maryland</i>. &quot;The young pair conceived the
  notion that their marriage would be opposed by parental authority, and so
  they, deciding to brook no obstacle to their happiness, walked away to
  Clarksburg one fine morning and were wedded.&quot; Eli and Rachel most likely
  expected disapproval because she was the daughter of a landowner and he was a
  laborer on the farm she was to inherit. After eloping, however, they
  experienced their parents’ blessings. The couple raised seven sons who
  survived to adulthood. Eli added more land to the farm Rachel inherited until
  it encompassed approximately 1,100 acres. It is likely that he was a slave
  owner, as the 1850 and 1860 censuses record a slave family on his farm. Upon
  his death, Eli Davis divided the farm among his many sons, including Samuel
  and Isaac.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Samuel B. Davis (1846-1902) owned and operated
  a general store at Fountain Mills across from the Davis farm; he also ran a
  mill and a small farm. He married Rebecca Ebert in 1877, and they raised two
  children, Saidee and E. Carlton (Carl). Isaac T. Davis (1841-1913) inherited
  the original house and about 250 acres. He married Sarah Frances Spalding
  (1842-1905), a Catholic, and raised five children, R. Lee (1867-1939), Charles
  (1871-1955), Nellie (1873-1950), Louis (1880-1918), and Rachel (1882-1948).
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">R. Lee played an active part in managing the
  farm for his father from 1895 onward, and he did much to modernize the Davis
  Farm operations, specializing in dairy farming. &quot;He [was] one of the most
  successful young farmers in this section, intelligent and fully ‘up-to-date’
  in his methods,&quot; according to J. C. Thomas Williams in his <i>History of
  Frederick County</i>. Lee’s stationary featured the farm’s new name,
  &quot;The Old Homestead Stock and Dairy Farm.&quot; For the dairy operations,
  he bought and bred Holstein-Friesian cows, joining Holstein-Friesian
  associations and obtaining official certificates for some of his cows. He sold
  milk and cream to retailers and merchants in Baltimore via the Baltimore and
  Ohio Railroad’s Monrovia station. At his father Isaac’s death in 1913, Lee
  paid his four siblings and his uncle Charles in order to have full ownership
  of the farm. For a brief period (ca. 1919-1920), Lee owned an automobile
  garage with his nephew, Frank Gaither (1896-1970), the Davis Overland Garage.
  During the last two decades of his life, Lee invested in oil and mining stocks
  in the South and West. These investments did not increase the family fortune;
  Lee’s granddaughter, Cora Lee Davis Winchester, investigated the value of
  the stocks and leases in 1967, discovering that the companies no longer
  existed. A number of tenant families lived on the Davis property during R. Lee’s
  lifetime, including the Toodle family, who may have been descended from the
  family of slaves owned by Eli Davis.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">R. Lee Davis married Cora U. Layton
  (1868-1915) in 1888. Together they raised three sons, R. Leslie Davis
  (1891-1942), Bernard M. Davis (1893-1981), and Aubrey Gaffney Davis
  (1895-1959), and a foster daughter, Florence Fair. Davis’s sister, Rachel,
  lived on the farm with the family until his death and when she joined her
  other brother, Charles, at his residence.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Although Davis continued to manage the farm
  until late in his life, his son Aubrey began to assist him with the farm
  operations as early as 1908. Aubrey married Ursula Burke Brown (1895-1967) in
  1916; they lived on the farm and there raised their three daughters, Catherine
  Davis Warner Voiles (b. 1917), Cora Lee Davis Winchester (b. 1918), and Audrey
  Davis Watkins (1920-1982). When his father passed away in 1939, Aubrey bought
  his two brothers' shares of the farm to become sole owner. In provisions of R.
  Lee Davis’s will, Rachel and Florence received small inheritances as well.
  Aubrey continued to modernize the farm, and he built a new dairy barn in 1943.
  His ledgers reflect that he relied upon farm labor from outside the family,
  often the sons of his tenant farmers. While demand for milk remained steady
  during World War II, there were shortages in supplies and labor. Aubrey’s
  daughters married men who were not interested in working on the farm. In
  January 1945, Aubrey sold the Davis farm to the Doody family intending to
  retire to Frederick, Maryland. Several years later he purchased a small farm
  nearby, which he ran until 1955.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">In 1998, Aubrey’s daughter, Cora Lee Davis
  Winchester, recorded the memories of her childhood on the farm with detail and
  affection. She remembered the farmhouse where she lived: &quot;When I was
  about ten the old kitchen and loft were torn down and an ell consisting of
  kitchen and dining room on the first floor and a bedroom, bath, and loft with
  a long hall was built by Mr. Will Hendrickson. This house with its long,
  screened front porch stands today (minus the shutters I used to hang from!).
  It had all the usual farm buildings: meat house, chicken house, spring house,
  and, of course, privy (each of the two houses had its own set of
  outbuildings).&quot; Of particular note is her description of family heirlooms
  in the living room: &quot;An ancient grandfather clock (built for William
  Morsell, Sr. by Eli Bentley of Taneytown) dominated the room, which was
  furnished with a piano, arm chairs, and two Hitchcock chairs. Grandmother’s
  desk (a Larkin) was there. . . . The bow-front china cabinet was also in this
  room. . . . Eli and Rachel Davis’ gold-framed photo portraits hung over the
  mantle.&quot;
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Although the size of the farm varied during
  the period when the Davis family owned it, the main portion was located near
  the intersection of present-day Maryland Routes 80 and 75 (Green Valley Road),
  in New Market, Frederick County.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">A Davis family tree is appended to this guide.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">SCOPE AND CONTENT</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The Davis family papers provide a detailed
  account of the accumulation of land and the operations of a family farm across
  several generations, with the most comprehensive records documenting the time
  of ownership by R. Lee Davis and his son Aubrey G. Davis between 1895 and
  1945. The activities surrounding the dairy operations and milk distribution to
  Baltimore are well documented in the farm ledgers and business correspondence.
  In his farm ledgers, Aubrey tracked wages paid to his farm workers by day or
  by task. In addition to the financial transactions made in operating the farm,
  the papers reveal the domestic consumer patterns of the Davis family between
  1886 and 1943.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The majority of the Davis collection relates
  to financial activities. The papers contain farm ledgers, account books, land
  deeds, wills, receipts and bills, business correspondence, and records of
  investments. The collection also contains blueprints and instructions for
  building a dairy barn, circa 1930s. Of particular note are two handwritten
  arithmetic books from the late eighteenth century. Through the sale
  agreements, land deeds and wills, one can trace the role of women in property
  transactions from the late eighteenth century through the middle of the
  twentieth century. Many of the wills and indentures include wives or
  daughters, even requiring their approval by signature as early as 1822.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The Davis family collection also contains five
  account books belonging to Samuel B. Davis, brother of R. Lee Davis, who ran a
  general store at Fountain Mills across from the family farm. These ledgers
  track the purchases made by individuals and families on credit over time and
  offer a glimpse into the daily life of this rural area of Frederick County,
  Maryland, in the 1890s.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">These papers cover the period 1784 to 1967,
  with the bulk of materials from the period 1890 to 1945. The earliest papers
  in the collection are land deeds and survey maps from the 1780s, and the
  latest are charts from Cora Lee Davis Winchester’s 1967 investigation of her
  grandfather R. Lee Davis’s investments.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The collection has been divided into the
  following series:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Series I: Farm Records<br>
  Series II: Family Records<br>
  Series III: Investments and Personal Insurance<br>
  Series IV: Fountain Mills Store Ledgers</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">PROVENANCE</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Michael Warner, great-great-grandson of R. Lee
  Davis, donated the papers to the University of Maryland Libraries in November
  1999. He donated additional, published materials in March 2000.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Series I: Farm Records, 1784-1945 (2.25 lin.
    ft.)<br>
</font></u><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">This series contains records related to
    the financial activities, insurance, farm operations, and acquisition of
    lands of the Davis family farm. These farm materials comprise the bulk of
    the Davis family collection.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Three account books belonging to William
  Morsell, Sr., covering the years 1796-1797, 1797, and 1799-1800, track
  transactions, credits and debits, and detailed household expenses. Within the
  listings of household expenses are records of wages paid to several servants.
  Farm ledgers belonging to R. Lee Davis and his son Aubrey G. Davis consist
  mostly of figures, credits, and debits, but the farm ledgers belonging to
  Aubrey alone are quite detailed. These five ledgers cover 1908 to 1944, and
  they record milk and cream accounts, notes recording when dairy cows are
  &quot;fresh,&quot; and accounts with laborers paid by day or by task.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The collection illuminates dairy activities on
  the Davis farm including the purchase of cows, milk distribution records, and
  blueprints for a new barn. The purchase materials consist of correspondence
  with cow breeders, a Maryland Holstein-Friesian Breeders’ Club Membership
  Card (1913), and cow registry certificates. Distribution records include
  Baltimore and Ohio Railroad shipping records and correspondence with the
  B&amp;O milk agent. Of particular note is the extensive correspondence with
  various Baltimore retailers, especially E. Donnelly, who complained of sour
  milk.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Records of farm operations include bills and
  receipts for purchases made for the farm, primarily supplies such as
  fertilizer, seed, horse harnesses, and barn repairs. There are bills for
  vehicle expenses, including buggy and wagon parts and, later, automobile
  repairs. Of special note are hand-drawn sketches of crop acreage use in the
  late 1930s and a draft copy of the 1935 U. S. Census of Agriculture Farm and
  Ranch schedule filled out in detail by R. Lee Davis.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Estate records contain land deeds, land
  surveys and maps, indentures, mortgages, sale agreements, and tenant
  contracts. William Morsell, Sr., William Morsell, Jr., and Eli Davis made the
  majority of land purchases. Later land records concern inheritance of the farm
  lands. Of particular interest is William Morsell, Sr.’s 1808 will and
  testament in which he expresses his intention to set his &quot;negro
  Abraham&quot; free. Three deeds of sale from 1822 indicate women’s indirect
  rights to property. Aubrey G. Davis’s 1945 farm ledger records the sale of
  the Davis farm.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Newspaper clippings and promotional
  advertisements from the 1890s relate to agriculture, especially dairy
  management, fertilizers, and machinery.

  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Arrangement is alphabetical by topic and then
  chronological.
</font></p>
  <u>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Series II: Family Records, 1788-1945 (0.75 lin.
  ft.)<br>
</font></u><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Series II contains documents related to
  domestic life on the Davis family farm. Correspondence concerning bills or
  receipts of payment for domestic purchases from 1886 to 1941 comprise the bulk
  of this series. There are records of Davis family accounts at several stores,
  which detail the family’s consumer patterns over time. Purchases of note
  include portraits from a Washington, D.C., artist’s studio, a gold watch
  with fob, a piano, a new Singer sewing machine (1903), and a Frigidaire
  refrigerator (1941). Two telephone service agreements document the family’s
  first telephone service in 1906 with Potomac Telephone Company and the
  addition of a second line in 1928 with Potomac Edison Company.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Advertisements and pamphlets dating from the
  1890s relate to medical remedies, especially ladies’ remedies, and to
  religion. The latter includes Catholic pamphlets and Apostleship of Prayer
  League leaflets belonging to Ursula Davis and Florence Fair. Of particular
  interest is a calendar page for April 1915, which marks the illness and death
  of Cora U. Davis in her husband R. Lee Davis’s handwriting.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">There are two manuscript arithmetic books from
  the late eighteenth century, one belonging to William Morsell and another to
  George Davis. A teacher’s account book, most likely dating from the 1880s,
  lists Saidee and Carl Davis as students who purchased textbooks.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The latest materials in this series are the
  World War II ration books belonging to Aubrey G. Davis, his wife Ursula, and
  his daughter Audrey.
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Arrangement is alphabetical by topic and then
  chronological.
</font></p>
  <u>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Series III: Investments and Personal
  Insurance, 1886-1967 (0.75 lin. ft.)<br>
</font></u><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">This series documents R. Lee Davis’s
  personal insurance and investments, detailing his attempts to assure his
  family’s financial security. During the 1920s and 1930s, Davis invested in
  numerous oil and mining companies in southern and western states, especially
  Texas. Promotional literature abounds, including a Texas oil map. There are
  stock certificates and leases for fractions of interest on potential oil or
  gas found upon particular plots of land. Notes, charts, and correspondence
  from 1967 document Cora Lee Davis Winchester’s investigation on behalf of
  the heirs into the value and legitimacy of these stocks. By then most of the
  companies were defunct, and one Texas county clerk informed her that the
  trusts had been &quot;purely promotional schemes.&quot;
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">The materials in this series also include
  correspondence and contracts with several insurance companies, as well as
  information pamphlets, bills, receipts, and extensions of payment. Of
  particular interest is the correspondence during the Depression of the 1930s,
  when R. Lee’s letters indicate his anxiety over the financial security of
  the Postal Mutual Benefit Corporation. Correspondence also outlines Lee’s
  illness, hospitalization, and death at the Maryland University Hospital in May
  1939.

  <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Series IV: Fountain Mills Store Ledgers,
  1884-1898 (0.75 lin. ft.)<br>
</font></u><font face="Arial" SIZE="+1">Five ledgers from Samuel B. Davis’s
  Fountain Mills store comprise this series. Three ledgers record in detail the
  purchases made on credit by individuals and families. Two account books record
  payments by customers on their individual accounts.
